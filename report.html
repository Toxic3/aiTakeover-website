    <h3>Ethan Champion's Report on A.I Takeover</h3>
    <h5>Introduction:</h5>
    <p>This newsletter was created in order to collect all the interesting stories surrounding artificial intelligence and display them in a centralised area.</p>
    <p>My target audience is anyone curious about Artificial Intelligence or anyone who researches it and might not have time to find news articles from various sources.</p>
    <p>I focused on making a responsive website so that anyone can access it, minimising JavaScript for example, and allowing scaling for all device sizes.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website:</h5>
    <p>I am intrigued by Artificial Intelligence, having gone to lectures around the topic. Also a huge inspiration was the book (and film) "I, Robot". My inspiration with regards to the website came mostly from <a href="aiweekly.co">A.I Weekly.</a></p>
    <h5>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible</h5>
    <p>Accessibility was one of my top priorities. I made sure that every image had an alt text so that screen readers can read out what the image is so no content is missing for anyone. I made sure that the website can scale down or up depending on the screen size so that even if a user does not have a full size desktop they will be able to experience the content still.</p>
    <p>I also made sure to minimise content on the website so that there is no limitations with regards to internet speed or bandwidth costs. It loads instantly.</p>
    <h5>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site</h5>
    <p>Usability was also a priority for me. I made sure that the website works on most browsers, even outdated ones. I also made sure that everything on the website was clear to read, and clearly organised in a logical and consistent way. I also added a contact us page with information on who we are and our goals, and a way for the users to contact us if they have any concerns.</p>
    <h5>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that</h5>
    <p>The first thing that I had to learn was the best ways to layout information with bootstrap. I checked the documentation to find out how and when to use different classes. I adapted the way my webpage was laid out to implement the better and simpler grid method that it provides.</p>
    <p>I also researched modern standards and ways that websites could be laid out to, for example, optimise search engine results, or simply to provide information and further accessibility. An example of this was icons for the website. Various devices require different sizes, and through research I found that it is best to include a "manifest.json" in the root directory which sets all these for each device.</p>
    <p>Another thing that I had to research was ways that I can use jQuery in order to manipulate the DOM to create newsletter templates. I found out multiple methods that I could use to achieve this, and used the one most useful for author's publishing their newsletter.</p>
    <h5>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h5>
    <p>I really like the layout that I achieved in my website, with the common theme and simplistic layout, achieved through bootstrap and CSS. I learnt a lot about methods to achieve certain styles, for example shadows and transitions in CSS.</p>
    <h5>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time?</h5>
    <p>If I had more time, I would definitely create a way of searching articles. This would be done possibly by Regular expression sorting through all the text of all the websites in the archive to find ones that match the topic, for example traffic.</p>
    <p>I would also rework the way the news articles are published, so that each has a unique page, possibly by using PHP.</p>
    <h5>What resources were used when creating your work?</h5>
    <p>Boiler-plate was used for a strong foundation to build upon, that was up to date with modern standards. <a href="licenses/boiler-plate.txt">License</a></p>
    <p>jQuery was used to manipulate the DOM in a simpler and more powerful manner.</p>
    <p>Bootstrap was used in order to create a more complex grid system to lay out the newsletters in a more complex way, to achieve a stronger visual.</p>
    <p>Modernizer and Normalize were included in the Boiler-plate template and simply help keep to common standards.</p>
